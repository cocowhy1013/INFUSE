- This is the testAdaptor version of INFUSE
- Differences between this version and the stable version:
  - configuration and implementation for gmc's testing, like change generation strategy (testModeDataConvertor method in CLIParser.java)
- any bug found in this version should be fixed in the stable version as well.
